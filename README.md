## Overview

Building my portfolio HTML wireframe expanded my skills in web development. I learned the basics of Figma design, enhanced my general site planning skills, and had fun experimenting with colors while choosing a color palette. Improving code readability with Semantic HTML was a priority. Additionally, I learned to prioritize accessibility through alt labeling and ARIA attributes. This journey not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of design.
